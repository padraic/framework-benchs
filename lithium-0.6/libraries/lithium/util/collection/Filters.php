/**
 * The `Filters` class is the basis of Lithium's method filtering system: an efficient way to enable
 * event-driven communication between classes without tight coupling and without depending on a
 * centralized publish/subscribe system.
 *
 * In Lithium itself, when creating a method that can be filtered, a method is implemented as a
 * [ closure](http://us2.php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php) and is passed to either
 * `Object::_filter()` or `StaticObject::_filter()`. Each object internally maintains its own list
 * of filters, which are applied in these methods and passed to `Filters::run()`.
 *
 * When implementing a custom filter system outside of Lithium, you can create your own list of
 * filters, and pass it to `$options['items']` in the `run()` method.
 *
 * When creating a filter to apply to a method, you need the name of the method you want to call,
 * along with a **closure**, that defines what you want the filter to do.  All filters take the same
 * 3 parameters: `$self`,`$params`, and `$chain`.
 *
 * - `$self`: If the filter is applied on an object instance, then `$self` will be that instance. If
 * applied to a static class, then `$self` will be a string containing the fully-namespaced class
 * name.
 *
 * - `$params`: Contains an associative array of the parameters that are passed into the method. You
 * can modify or inspect these parameters before allowing the method to continue.
 *
 * - `$chain`: Finally, `$chain` contains the list of filters in line to be executed (as an
 * instance of the `Filters` class).  At the bottom of `$chain` is the method itself.  This is why
 * most filters contain a line that looks like this:
 *
 * {{{return $chain->next($self, $params, $chain);}}}
 *
 * This passes control to the next filter in the chain, and finally, to the method itself.  This
 * allows you to interact with the return value as well as the parameters.
 *
 * Within the framework, you can call `applyFilter()` on any object (static or instantiated) and
 * pass the name of the method you would like to filter, along with the filter itself. For example:
 *
 * {{{use \lithium\action\Dispatcher;
 *
 * Dispatcher::applyFilter('run', function($self, $params, $chain) {
 * 	// Custom pre-dispatch logic goes here
 * 	$response = $chain->next($self, $params, $chain);
 *
 * 	// $response now contains a Response object with the result of the dispatched request,
 * 	// and can be modified as appropriate
 * 	// ...
 * 	return $response;
 * });}}}
 *
 * The logic in the closure will now be executed on every call to `Dispatcher::run()`, and
 * `$response` will always be modified by any custom logic present before being returned from
 * `run()`.

	 *          By default, execution will be nested such that the first item will be executed
	 *          first, and will be the last to return.
	 * @return Returns the value returned by the first closure in `$options['items`]`.
